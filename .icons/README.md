# TrackTitan Icons

This is for generating the icons we want in our application, it means we can use the icons from any source as long as we have the svg.

## Generating the icon components

To generate the icon components is as simple as running:

```
npm run generate-icons
```

This will automatically create the icons.tsx file we need and export each of the svgs as an react component.

## Adding new icons

When adding new icons they should be added with a height of 24px and a width of 24px
